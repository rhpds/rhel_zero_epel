description: In this lab, you will learn about [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
  (EPEL)](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/), a repository of packages designed
  to increase the flexibility of working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. EPEL has been
  curated such that none of the packages in EPEL should conflict with anything that
  ships with RHEL, meaning that EPEL enables greater flexibility for users while maximizing
  compatibility with RHEL.
